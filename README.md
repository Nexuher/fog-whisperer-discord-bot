# Fog Whisperer - Dead By Daylight bot
The bot was purely made as a small project in order to learn Python and make something that connects my interests in something that would be enjoyable, that I would learn something along the process, and would be used for me in the game.

Fog Whisperer is an assistance bot which can:
- Choose by random your perks for the next match for killer or the survivor,
- Choose randomly the next offering for the map, if you're looking up for a challenge,
- Provide an information for specific map or perk you're interested in learning

Fog whisperer is currently in development, as It's far from what I want it to be.
